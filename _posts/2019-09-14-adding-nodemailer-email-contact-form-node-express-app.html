    <p>Contact forms are a classic web pattern to allow your visitors to email you straight from the page they're on without exposing your email address. This can be great for getting customer leads for marketing sites or soliciting feedback from your visitors. Node.js/Express apps can the <a href="https://nodemailer.com/">Nodemailer</a> package to add email functionality to your portfolio or small business site. This tutorial will show you how to use Nodemailer in your Node/Express app to let your users easily contact you.</p>
    <div class="notice">
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> This site is now a Jekyll static site served with GitHub Pages. I don't use this email contact form code in production anymore, though many of my readers do. To see a contact form in the context of a working app, visit my old <a href="https://github.com/ty2k/express-portfolio">express-portfolio repo on GitHub</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>If you haven't already got an Express app ready to add to, start with the <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html">Installing Express instructions</a>.</p>
    <h2>Install Nodemailer</h2>
    <p>Installing Nodemailer into your project is simple with <code class="mono">npm</code>. In your project folder, run:</p>
    <pre><code class="mono">npm install nodemailer</code></pre>
    <h2>Setup server.js</h2>
    <p>Next, in your <code class="mono">server.js</code> file (or whatever file you run to start your Express server), require Nodemailer near the top of your file, before setting your routes:</p>
    <pre><code class="mono">const nodemailer = require('nodemailer')</code></pre>
    <p>Now that you have Nodemailer installed in your project and you are requiring it in your server, you can access its functionality in the new route you will create.</p>
    <p>If you haven’t, you should read the <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html">official Express routing documentation</a> to give yourself a better understanding of how routes work in Express applications.</p>
    <p>My <code class="mono">server.js</code> file is going to use the conventional Express setup shown in their routing documentation:</p>
<pre><code class="mono">const express = require('express')
const app = express()</code></pre>
    <p>I will be using the middleware package <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser">body-parser</a> to parse the data from the contact form we will create. Install it as a dependency:</p>
    <pre><code class="mono">npm install body-parser</code></pre>
    <p>Then near the top of <code class="mono">server.js</code> under your Express requirements, require body-parser and <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#app.use" title="Express API app.use documentation">mount it with <code class="mono">use()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code class="mono">const bodyParser = require('body-parser')
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}))</code></pre>
    <h2>Write a route using Nodemailer</h2>
    <p>Now your application is ready to have routes added to it. We will need a simple <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST">POST method</a> route for Nodemailer to use when a user submits the contact form.</p>
    <p>Here is what my POST method route looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="mono">// POST route from contact form
app.post('/contact', (req, res) => {

  // Instantiate the SMTP server
  const smtpTrans = nodemailer.createTransport({
    host: 'smtp.gmail.com',
    port: 465,
    secure: true,
    auth: {
      user: GMAIL_USER,
      pass: GMAIL_PASS
    }
  })

  // Specify what the email will look like
  const mailOpts = {
    from: 'Your sender info here', // This is ignored by Gmail
    to: GMAIL_USER,
    subject: 'New message from contact form at tylerkrys.ca',
    text: `${req.body.name} (${req.body.email}) says: ${req.body.message}`
  }

  // Attempt to send the email
  smtpTrans.sendMail(mailOpts, (error, response) => {
    if (error) {
      res.render('contact-failure') // Show a page indicating failure
    }
    else {
      res.render('contact-success') // Show a page indicating success
    }
  })
})</code></pre>
    <p>The route contains my <a href="https://nodemailer.com/smtp/" title="Nodemailer SMTP Transport documentation">SMTP transport server</a> (<code class="mono">smtpTrans</code>), a set of email formatting options I define (<code class="mono">mailOpts</code>), and a call to the <code class="mono">sendMail</code> function with conditional logic to display either a <code class="mono">contact-failure</code> or <code class="mono">contact-success</code> view.</p>
    <p>You will notice I’m using Gmail as my SMTP server. Gmail is <a href="https://community.nodemailer.com/using-gmail/">not the best solution to use with Nodemailer</a>, but it is a free solution most people will have easy access to. The <code class="mono">host</code>, <code class="mono">port</code>, and <code class="mono">secure</code> values in the SMTP server are all specific to Gmail, and will need to change depending on the SMTP server settings you are dealing with if you don't use Gmail.</p>
    <p>The <code class="mono">GMAIL_USER</code> and <code class="mono">GMAIL_PASS</code> variables in the <code class="mono">auth:</code> configuration are references to my own <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/learn/command-line/how-to-read-environment-variables-from-nodejs">environment variables</a> in my Node application.</p>
<pre><code class="mono">const GMAIL_USER = process.env.GMAIL_USER
const GMAIL_PASS = process.env.GMAIL_PASS</code></pre>
    <p>Always make sure to keep information like your email address and password out of public code repositories like GitHub! For a nice npm package to help you set environment variables in Node.js, try <a href=https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv>dotenv</a> or use Node 20's native .env file support.</p>
    <p>Also note that in this case, <code class="mono">GMAIL_PASS</code> doesn’t refer to my everyday Gmail password, but to a <a href=https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords>Google application-specific password</a> I have created.</p>
    <p>Note that Gmail sets the authenticated user (you) as the <code class="mono">From:</code> email address, so you will need to manually pass the sender’s email address into the subject or body of the email if you would like it to be sent to you. You can see how I get around this limitation by including the email address in the <code class="mono">text</code> property of the <code class="mono">mailOpts</code> object:</p>
<pre><code class="mono">text: `${req.body.name} (${req.body.email}) says: ${req.body.message}`</code></pre>
    <p>Here, I’m using body-parser to grab the fields <code class="mono">name</code>, <code class="mono">email</code>, and <code class="mono">message</code> from the incoming POST request in order to fill the body text of the email that will be sent. See <a href="https://nodemailer.com/message/">Nodemailer's message configuration documentation</a> for all the values you can set in your mail object.</p>
    <p>The <code class="mono">smtpTrans.sendMail()</code> function uses the <code class="mono">mailOpts</code> object as its first argument. The second argument is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function">callback function</a> that will use the <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.render"><code class="mono">res.render()</code> function in Express</a> to show a success or failure page (which is beyond the scope of this article).</p>
    <h2>Setup the HTML form</h2>
    <p>Now that we have our back-end route written in our Node/Express server, we are ready for the front-end HTML. Here is an extremely basic form you can add structure or styling to:</p>
<pre><code class="mono">&lt;form action=&quot;/contact&quot; id=&quot;contact-form&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; role=&quot;form&quot;&gt;
  &lt;fieldset&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input
      id=&quot;name&quot;
      name=&quot;name&quot;
      type=&quot;text&quot;
      placeholder=&quot;Your name&quot;
      required
    /&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;email&quot;&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input
      id=&quot;email&quot;
      name=&quot;email&quot;
      type=&quot;text&quot;
      placeholder=&quot;Your email&quot;
      required
    /&gt;
    &lt;label for=&quot;message&quot;&gt;Message&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;textarea
      id=&quot;message&quot;
      name=&quot;message&quot;
      placeholder=&quot;Enter your message here&quot;
      rows=&quot;3&quot;
      required
    &lt;/textarea&gt;
    &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
  &lt;/fieldset&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>It is vital that the form’s <code class="mono">action</code> attribute points to the same route location in <code class="mono">server.js</code> that we specified earlier (<code class="mono">action=&quot;/contact&quot;</code> here matches with <code class="mono">app.post('/contact'</code> on our server). The form’s <code class="mono">method</code> is <code class="mono">post</code> to comply with <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>RESTful conventions</a>.</p>
    <p>The <code class="mono">name</code> fields that you specify for the <code class="mono">input</code> and <code class="mono">textarea</code> elements correspond to how we access those values in our request body back on the server (<code class="mono">req.body.name</code>, <code class="mono">req.body.email</code>, and <code class="mono">req.body.message</code>).</p>
    <p>The <code class="mono">role=&quot;form&quot;</code> attribute is to assist with accessibility for users with screen-readers or similar devices.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion and limitations</h2>
    <p>This method of contact form creation is not very robust for deployment on high traffic sites. Gmail limits the number of emails you can send in a day, and busy sites will definitely attract a lot of spam, phishing, and injection attempts with this kind of setup. We also have not touched on <a href="https://nodemailer.com/smtp/pooled/">pooled SMTP with Nodemailer</a> or other considerations that a high-volume environment would require.</p>
    <p>For me, this contact form design solved the basic problem of how to let people contact me without showing them my email address while I had it in production. It should be sufficient for the average portfolio site or small business marketing site.</p>
    <p>Stretch goal: Add a verification requirement to your form so a human can fill it out but a spambot would get stuck. You can track down how I did this in my <a href="https://github.com/ty2k/express-portfolio">express-portfolio GitHub repo</a>.</p>
    <p>I recommend <a href="https://nodemailer.com/about/">Nodemailer's documentation</a> for help with writing your server code. Their docs are excellent.</p>
